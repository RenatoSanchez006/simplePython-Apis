					<p class="center-title color-text2"> So... why did we choose Python as our programming language?</p>
					<p class="center-title color-text2">Did you know that Python has overtaken French in primary schools? No coincidence at all when 6 out of 10 parents prefer their child learns Python instead of French, who knew?</p>
					<p class="center-title color-text2">Not only that, but it is one of the official languages at Google (let me remind you that Google is one of the world's biggest companies) and they surely have a good reason for it.</p>
					<p class="center-title color-text2">Python is a lot like English in the sense that you can easily read and understand what each line of code is doing. There are hundreds of more reasons why we chose Python as our programming language but we wouldn't finish. This is just the begginning...</p>
